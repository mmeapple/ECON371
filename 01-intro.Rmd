## Critical reading

Seminar questions will be closely connected to the readings and lecture material.  These are some of the steps that you can take to ensure that you get a deeper understanding of the readings that we will do in the course:

1. Read selectively
2. Formulate questions: what, when, where, who, how, why
3. Actively search for the answers to these questions
4. Reflect on the reading: why did you read it? Do you trust the argument? What is missing? What else would you like to know?

At the end of your reading exercise, make sure you can answer the following questions:

- [ ] In one sentence, what is the argument of the reading?
- [ ] What makes this argument different than other perspectives on the topic?
- [ ] What methods and evidence are used to support the argument? 
- [ ] Are these methods and evidence enough to support the argument? Is there something missing?
